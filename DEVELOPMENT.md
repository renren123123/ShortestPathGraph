Timeline:

November 1st - November 6th :

Discussion regarding what data type we are going to use and what algorithm we want to implement. We decided to go with routes.dat from OpenFlights. 
As a group we developed a timeline and made our Final project proposal. We decided on DFS, Djikstra, and page rank as our algorithms.

November 8th - 12th:

Discussing on how we want to split the work, and how much time we are going to allocate to each algorithm or problem. Ideally we want to have a decent chunk finished by Thanksgiving break. Ren began working on parsing the data and deciding on a format for our graph.

November 15th - 19th:

Finalizing the way to parse the data and the code to do so. We decided to use a map that uses the airport code as the key and has a vector of strings, which contains all the airports that it can go to. Pax began working on the DFS using the pseudo-code from the lectures as a base to work with. We want the Traversal to return a path from an origin to a destination.

November 22nd - 26th:

Break...

November 29th - December 3rd:

We are behind from where we wanted to be. We didn't really start working on our algorithms until this week. Starting to make testcases for parsing the data and making the graph. DFS is almost finished. A few bugs need to be fixed but the vast majority of the code is there. In addition to that, Djikstra's has began being worked on. 

December 6th - December 13th:

Pax was running into a few issues with how to return a solution for the DFS. Pax decided to change to BFS because it would be easier to get a solution for a shorter path for two points. Furthermore, Djikstras was finished and test cases for both were finished. We decided to switch from PageRank to HierHolzer because we realized that Pagerank would take a lot more work to implement. We also did not start it until this week. All 3 of us colaborated on it and finished it this week. We finished test cases for everything and we finished our driver.cpp which is how the user can interact with our code and use our algorithms.
